* Create Xcode4 project:
    - Choose Cocoa application as template.
    - Delete AppDelegate.* and main.m files.

    - Target -> Build Phases -> Link Binary With Libraries:
        - add OpenGL.framework
        - add SDL frameworks from `macosx/frameworks` dir
    - Add build phase for copying files to `Frameworks`.
    - Add the same SDL frameworks to the new phase.
    - Target -> Build Settings:
        - `Header Search Paths`: add SDL framework `Headers` subfolders
        - example: "$(SRCROOT)/../macosx/frameworks/SDL2.framework/Headers"

    - Add liblua.a to `Link With Libraries`.
    - Add "$(SRCROOT)/../../lua-5.1/src" to header search paths.
 
    - Add all `game-2d/src` files to project.
    - Add `game2d-cfg.h` file to project.

    - Add macosx/bundle_path.* file to project (they contain an Objective-C
      function that sets current working directory to app bundle dir).
      
    - For SDL1.2 add macosx/SDL_main.* files to project.

    - Add "@executable_path/../Frameworks" as `Runpath Search Paths`
      build setting.

    - Add new group to project and name it "Data" (name does not matter).
    - Add game data files that should go into bundle to the new group
      (make sure to "add folder references", not "sub groups").

* Modify framework paths for SDL, SDL_image, and SDL_mixer libs: 
    $ install_name_tool -id @executable_path/../Frameworks/SDL.framework/SDL /Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework/SDL
    .. etc ..

* Codesign all frameworks that are added to published app bundle:
    $ codesign -vvvv -s 'Mac Developer Application Certificate name' SDL.framework
    .. etc ..

  NOTE: Frameworks within other frameworks must also be signed.
